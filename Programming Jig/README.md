# PawPad Programming Jig
This is an experimental programming jig for PawPad. It still requires real world testing, but continuity tests have proven the design to be sound.

## Use case
This jig is meant to fan out the PawPad connector to the common SWD and ICSP connectors. 
Please do not try to connect them together or plug in other programmers than what you intend to use, as there is no protection circuitry on this!

## How to assemble
Soldering the jig is difficult, it is recommended that you order or get more than a single PCB made. That way you can screw them together and use the holes to keep the pogo pins straight. 

However, due to the size, it should be noted that they might be hard to solder by hand, and might require some fiddling get it to work.

## Future plans
* Add a 3D printable jig to hold the pogo pins in place
* Create a cheaper mounting solution
